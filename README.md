**>** 🌟 Projects:
**🎭 Emotion Detection System
Explore my Emotion Detection System project, where I developed a machine learning model to accurately
detect emotions from facial expressions. Utilizing deep learning techniques and a curated dataset, this
project contributes to the field of affective computing.**



**🦓 Animal Detection with YOLOv8 and Streamlit RESTful API
Discover my implementation of a YOLOv8-based deep learning
model for real-time animal detection. Achieved high accuracy 
through dataset curation and computer vision techniques,
integrated with a Flask RESTful API for seamless application integration.**

**📸 **Instagram Automation with Python
Learn about my use of Python libraries like instabot and instapy for automating Instagram tasks.
Developed functionalities for account authentication, image uploading, user following, and data retrieval,
bolstered with error handling and security measures for reliability.**
